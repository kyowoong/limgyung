<h2>dear my LIM.</h2>
<h4>This one is not programmed to use Korean I don't know how to change to korean. I want to write letter but it is too difficult to me. I'm sorry Lim T.T I don't know how to this letter because I'm not good at English. but I'll do my best.</h4><p>
   I've never been like this before. I just don't know how to pour out my feelings for you. I love you. I know you'll find it hard to believe me if I tell you now how much you mean to me. you are the only woman that can understand me, and you can only reach it.<p>
     you are beautiful and I can't help but fall for ou deeper every day. and my pride and joy and gratitude that you should love me with such a perfect love are beyond all exprression.<p>
